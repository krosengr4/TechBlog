What I still have to do: 

- On profile page, add functionality for user to update post

- Debug date created on functionality

- Add functionality to include comments with the comment, user who posted it, and date created

- On profile page, add functionality to *ONLY* show users posts

- On blogpost page, add like and dislike functionality
